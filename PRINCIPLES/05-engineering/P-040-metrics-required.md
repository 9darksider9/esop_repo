# P-040 Metrics Required

## Statement

Controls without metrics are theater.

## Reasoning

A control that cannot be measured cannot be validated. Without metrics,
organizations cannot distinguish between controls that function and
controls that exist only on paper. Security posture claims require
quantitative evidence.

Metrics enable continuous validation, trend analysis, anomaly detection,
and informed prioritization. Unmeasured controls provide false assurance.

## Justification

Post-incident analysis frequently reveals that controls believed to be
effective were misconfigured, bypassed, or non-operational. Without
metrics, these failures persist undetected until exploitation.

Compliance audits that accept control existence without operational
metrics create systemic false confidence. Attackers exploit the gap
between documented controls and actual security posture.

## Operational Uses

- Control effectiveness dashboards.
- Coverage metrics for security tooling.
- Mean time to detect and respond measurements.
- Exception and bypass rate tracking.
- Trend analysis for control degradation.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Gaming metrics without improving actual security.
- Measuring what is easy rather than what matters.
- Alert fatigue from metric-driven alerting.
- Over-investment in measurement infrastructure.
