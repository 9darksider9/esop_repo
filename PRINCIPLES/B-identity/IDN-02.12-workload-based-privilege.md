# IDN-02.12 — Workload-Based Privilege

## Statement

Privilege must follow workload reality, not organizational charts.

## Reasoning

Access needs are determined by what systems and data a workload
requires, not by organizational hierarchy. Title-based or
org-chart-based privilege grants access based on organizational fiction
rather than operational necessity. Workload-based privilege aligns
access to actual requirements.

Access decisions must reflect technical reality, not political reality.

## Justification

Organizational structures change frequently; access requirements do not
always follow. Senior titles often correlate with broader access than
needed. Role inheritance grants accumulated privilege rather than
current need. Workload-based privilege breaks the connection between
hierarchy and access.

## Operational Uses

- Access decisions based on workload requirements, not titles.
- Regular validation of access against actual usage.
- Separation of organizational roles from access roles.
- Workload identity for compute resources.
- Access patterns informing privilege right-sizing.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Workload definition complexity.
- Resistance from users expecting title-based access.
- Difficulty in dynamic workload environments.
- Gaming workload definitions to obtain access.
