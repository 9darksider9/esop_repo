# AUT-03.09 — Reliability Over Cleverness

## Statement

Reliability beats cleverness.

## Reasoning

Clever solutions are often fragile, difficult to understand, and hard
to maintain. Reliable solutions are predictable, debuggable, and
sustainable. Security depends on systems that work consistently, not
systems that work impressively.

When choosing between clever and reliable, choose reliable.

## Justification

Clever automation fails in unexpected ways that are difficult to
diagnose. Clever architectures resist understanding by anyone other
than their creators. Clever workarounds accumulate as technical debt.
Security incidents are resolved faster with simple, reliable systems
than with sophisticated, fragile ones.

## Operational Uses

- Simplicity as a design criterion.
- Maintainability reviews for complex solutions.
- Documentation requirements for non-obvious approaches.
- Preference for proven patterns over novel solutions.
- Technical debt tracking for clever implementations.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Using reliability as excuse to avoid necessary innovation.
- Over-simplification that misses important requirements.
- Rejecting appropriate complexity for genuine complexity.
- Stagnation from excessive conservatism.
