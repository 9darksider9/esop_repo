# AUT-03.01 — Eliminate Manual Execution

## Statement

Manual execution does not scale and must be eliminated.

## Reasoning

Security operations performed manually are inherently limited by human
capacity. Manual processes cannot keep pace with modern attack velocity,
cannot maintain consistency across large environments, and cannot
operate continuously without fatigue and error.

What cannot be automated cannot be sustained at scale.

## Justification

Organizations dependent on manual security operations experience
delayed response, inconsistent enforcement, and operator burnout.
Attackers operate at machine speed; manual defenders operate at human
speed. This asymmetry guarantees that manual operations fall behind.

## Operational Uses

- Automation roadmaps for all repetitive security tasks.
- Metrics tracking manual versus automated operations.
- Toil budgets limiting acceptable manual work.
- Automation prioritization based on frequency and risk.
- Technical debt tracking for non-automated processes.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Premature automation of poorly understood processes.
- Automation replacing human judgment where judgment is required.
- Technical debt from rushed automation.
- Loss of institutional knowledge when processes are automated.
