# P-031 Human Toil Signal

## Statement

Human toil is a signal of architectural failure.

## Reasoning

When humans perform repetitive, automatable work, the architecture has
failed to provide appropriate automation. Toil consumes human capacity
that should be reserved for judgment and creativity. Persistent toil
indicates either missing automation or automation that does not meet
operational needs.

Toil is not inevitable; it is a defect to be remediated.

## Justification

Security teams consumed by toil cannot perform strategic work, respond
effectively to novel threats, or maintain the vigilance required for
high-stakes decisions. Organizations that accept toil as normal
guarantee that their best people spend time on their lowest-value work.

## Operational Uses

- Toil measurement and tracking as key metrics.
- Toil budgets limiting acceptable manual work.
- Architecture reviews assessing toil impact.
- Automation investment justified by toil reduction.
- Career incentives aligned with toil elimination.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Labeling all manual work as toil when judgment is required.
- Automation pressure leading to poor automation.
- Toil metrics gamed through task redefinition.
- Ignoring necessary manual work as toil to be eliminated.
