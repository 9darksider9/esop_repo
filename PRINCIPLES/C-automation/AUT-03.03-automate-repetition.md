# AUT-03.03 — Automate Repetition

## Statement

Any task repeated twice must be automated or scheduled for automation.

## Reasoning

Repetition signals opportunity for automation. When a task is performed
more than once, the pattern is established and the investment in
automation has a known return. Tolerating repeated manual work
accumulates toil and forgoes consistency benefits.

Automation debt compounds. Early automation prevents accumulated manual
burden.

## Justification

Organizations that defer automation accumulate operational debt that
consumes increasing human resources. Each repeated manual task
represents lost efficiency, increased error probability, and reduced
capacity for judgment-requiring work. Aggressive automation frees
humans for work that requires human judgment.

## Operational Uses

- Runbook documentation as first step toward automation.
- Automation triggers when tasks are performed twice.
- Toil tracking to identify automation candidates.
- Automation sprints as regular operational practice.
- ROI tracking for automation investments.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Automating before understanding the task fully.
- Automation scope creep beyond original task.
- Insufficient testing of automated replacements.
- Losing ability to perform tasks manually when needed.
