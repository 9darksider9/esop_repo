# AUT-03.10 — Understanding Over Action

## Statement

Automation must reduce mean time to understanding, not just mean time
to action.

## Reasoning

Speed without understanding leads to incorrect actions. Automation that
accelerates response without improving comprehension may cause faster
wrong actions. The goal is not just to act quickly but to act correctly,
which requires understanding the situation before acting.

Fast and wrong is worse than slow and right.

## Justification

Incident response often fails not because of slow action but because
of incorrect action based on incomplete understanding. Automation that
executes responses before operators understand the situation may
amplify damage. Understanding must precede action, and automation
should support both.

## Operational Uses

- Automated context gathering before response options.
- Dashboards that explain, not just display.
- Decision support that surfaces relevant information.
- Pause points in playbooks for understanding validation.
- Metrics on decision quality, not just decision speed.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Analysis paralysis delaying necessary action.
- Information overload obscuring understanding.
- Understanding requirements slowing critical response.
- Misattribution of delay to understanding rather than confusion.
