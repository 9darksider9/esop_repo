# ETH-06.05 — Power Asymmetry

## Statement

Power asymmetry must be acknowledged and constrained.

## Reasoning

Security systems create power imbalances: those with access versus
those without, those who monitor versus those monitored, those who
define policy versus those subject to policy. Unacknowledged power
asymmetry invites abuse. Constraints ensure that power is used
appropriately.

Power without constraint becomes abuse.

## Justification

Security capabilities—surveillance, access control, enforcement—
create significant power over individuals and systems. This power can
be misused for purposes beyond legitimate security. Acknowledging
asymmetry enables appropriate constraints. Ignoring asymmetry enables
unchecked authority.

## Operational Uses

- Separation of duties for high-power roles.
- Oversight mechanisms for security capabilities.
- Audit of security power usage.
- Escalation paths for power abuse concerns.
- Regular review of power distribution.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Constraint overhead impeding legitimate security work.
- Constraints circumvented through exception processes.
- Power asymmetry acknowledged but not actually constrained.
- Overcorrection reducing necessary security capabilities.
