# P-060 External Defensibility

## Statement

Systems must be defensible under external scrutiny.

## Reasoning

Security programs operate under increasing external scrutiny from
regulators, customers, partners, and the public. Systems that cannot
withstand scrutiny—because they are inadequate, inexplicable, or
indefensible—create organizational liability. Defensibility must be
designed in, not retrofitted when scrutiny arrives.

If you cannot defend it externally, you should not build it internally.

## Justification

Organizations increasingly face external review of their security
practices through regulatory examination, customer due diligence,
and post-incident investigation. Practices that seemed acceptable
internally often appear inadequate externally. Building for
defensibility ensures that scrutiny reveals strength rather than
weakness.

## Operational Uses

- External defensibility as design criterion.
- Documentation supporting external explanation.
- Regular external assessment and audit.
- Incident response with defensibility in mind.
- Stakeholder communication preparation.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Defensibility focus creating documentation burden.
- Designing for scrutiny rather than actual security.
- Defensibility becoming excuse for security theater.
- Over-preparation for unlikely scrutiny scenarios.
