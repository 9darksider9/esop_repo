# P-055 Data Collection Justified

## Statement

Data collection must be justified.

## Reasoning

Every piece of data collected creates storage cost, security liability,
and potential for misuse. Collection without justification accumulates
data that provides no value while creating exposure. Justification
ensures that collection decisions are deliberate, not default.

If you cannot articulate why you collect it, you should not collect it.

## Justification

Organizations accumulate data reflexively, creating vast repositories
of information with unclear purpose. This data becomes a liability:
attractive to attackers, subject to regulatory scrutiny, and expensive
to protect. Justified collection limits exposure to data that provides
clear value.

## Operational Uses

- Data collection justification requirements.
- Regular review of collected data against stated purposes.
- Data inventory with purpose documentation.
- Retention aligned to collection justification.
- Collection termination when justification expires.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Justification becoming pro-forma approval.
- Over-restriction preventing legitimate collection.
- Justification overhead slowing necessary collection.
- Gaming justification language to collect anything.
