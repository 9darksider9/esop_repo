# P-057 Data Minimization

## Statement

Data minimization reduces blast radius.

## Reasoning

Data that does not exist cannot be breached. Minimizing data
collection, retention, and distribution reduces the scope of potential
compromise. Every piece of sensitive data is a potential liability;
minimization limits liability by limiting data.

Less data means less to protect and less to lose.

## Justification

Breaches affecting organizations with extensive data holdings cause
more damage than breaches affecting organizations with minimal data.
Data minimization is a force multiplier for all other security
controls—there is simply less attack surface to defend.

## Operational Uses

- Collection limitation to minimum necessary data.
- Retention policies that delete data when no longer needed.
- Distribution controls limiting data propagation.
- Anonymization and pseudonymization where feasible.
- Regular data purge aligned to minimization policy.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Over-minimization deleting operationally necessary data.
- Minimization conflicting with forensic retention needs.
- Complexity of minimizing data in distributed systems.
- Minimization theater without actual data reduction.
