# ETH-06.08 — Vendor Assessment

## Statement

Third parties must meet security requirements before integration; trust
is not inherited.

## Reasoning

Third-party integrations extend organizational attack surface. Vendors
with weak security practices introduce risk regardless of internal
controls. Trust must be verified through assessment, not assumed based
on relationship or reputation.

Pre-integration assessment ensures that third parties meet security
requirements before they gain access to organizational resources.

## Justification

Supply chain attacks and third-party breaches increasingly compromise
organizations through their vendors. Attackers target the weakest link.
Organizations inherit the security posture of every integrated third
party.

Post-integration discovery of security deficiencies is expensive and
may require severing critical business relationships.

## Operational Uses

- Security questionnaires and assessments before contracting.
- Contractual security requirements and audit rights.
- Tiered assessment based on access and data sensitivity.
- Periodic reassessment of existing vendors.
- Security requirements in procurement processes.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Assessment theater that checks boxes without evaluating risk.
- Blocking business-critical integrations for minor issues.
- Assessment burden falling on smaller vendors disproportionately.
- Point-in-time assessments missing ongoing security changes.
