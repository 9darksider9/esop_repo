# P-058 Transparency

## Statement

Transparency increases trust and correctness.

## Reasoning

Security through obscurity fails. Transparent security practices
enable external validation, invite constructive scrutiny, and build
stakeholder trust. Opaque security creates suspicion, hides errors,
and resists improvement. Transparency is a property of robust security.

Sunlight is the best disinfectant.

## Justification

Organizations that hide their security practices cannot receive
external feedback, cannot benchmark against peers, and cannot build
trust with stakeholders. Transparency forces rigor—practices must be
defensible because they will be seen. Hidden practices accumulate
hidden defects.

## Operational Uses

- Security program documentation and disclosure.
- External audit and assessment programs.
- Stakeholder communication about security posture.
- Vulnerability disclosure processes.
- Incident communication protocols.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Transparency revealing exploitable information.
- Transparency burden affecting security operations.
- Transparency without substance becoming theater.
- Information asymmetry between disclosure and protection.
