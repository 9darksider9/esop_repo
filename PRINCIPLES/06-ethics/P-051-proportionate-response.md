# P-051 Proportionate Response

## Statement

Security responses must be proportionate to verified risk; overreach
erodes trust.

## Reasoning

Security controls impose costs: friction, complexity, reduced
productivity, and constrained capabilities. These costs are justified
only when proportionate to actual risk. Disproportionate responses
damage organizational trust, encourage workarounds, and waste resources.

Proportionality requires verified risk assessment, not hypothetical
worst-cases or reactive escalation.

## Justification

Organizations that impose severe controls for minor risks create
adversarial relationships with their users. Users bypass controls,
create shadow systems, and stop reporting issues. The security function
loses credibility and influence.

Overreach also consumes resources that could address higher-priority
risks. Every control has opportunity cost.

## Operational Uses

- Risk-based control selection during design.
- Graduated response procedures in incident handling.
- Exception processes that consider proportionality.
- Periodic review of control burden versus risk reduction.
- User feedback mechanisms for control impact.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Using proportionality to justify underinvestment in security.
- Difficulty quantifying risk leading to arbitrary judgments.
- Pressure to minimize controls for convenience.
- Hindsight criticism when proportionate controls prove insufficient.
