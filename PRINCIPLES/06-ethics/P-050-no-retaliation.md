# P-050 Data Non-Retaliation

## Statement

Telemetry and security data must not be used as the sole basis for
retaliation or disciplinary action without independent corroboration and
formal governance review.

## Reasoning

Operational telemetry captures system behavior, not human intent. Using
telemetry as a disciplinary weapon suppresses reporting, incentivizes
data manipulation, and degrades observability integrity. However,
legitimate investigations must remain possible under proper governance.

## Justification

Organizations that weaponize telemetry experience underreporting, shadow
systems, falsified metrics, and delayed incident disclosure. These
behaviors materially increase risk and degrade incident response
effectiveness.

Separating operational learning from disciplinary enforcement preserves
both trust and accountability.

## Operational Uses

- Blameless postmortems.
- Incident root cause analysis.
- HR escalation with corroboration.
- Insider threat governance separation.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Shielding malicious insiders if misinterpreted.
- Delayed response to legitimate misconduct.
- Governance bottlenecks during urgent investigations.
