# ENG-05.09 — Security Debt Compounds

## Statement

Security debt compounds faster than technical debt.

## Reasoning

Deferred security improvements accumulate risk that compounds over
time. Unlike technical debt that slows development, security debt
increases exposure to threats that continue to evolve. The threat
landscape does not wait for remediation schedules.

Security debt accrues interest at the rate of threat evolution.

## Justification

Organizations that defer security improvements find that accumulated
debt becomes increasingly expensive to remediate. Attack techniques
advance while defenses remain static. The gap between threat capability
and defense capability widens. Eventually, security debt becomes too
expensive to repay and must be written off through incident cost.

## Operational Uses

- Security debt tracking and visibility.
- Debt service as regular investment allocation.
- Debt impact analysis considering threat evolution.
- Prioritization based on debt risk, not just debt age.
- Architecture reviews preventing new debt accumulation.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Debt hysteria preventing measured risk acceptance.
- Debt metrics gamed through re-categorization.
- Debt reduction displacing new capability development.
- Paralysis from accumulated debt burden.
