# P-045 Controls Declare Purpose

## Statement

Security controls must declare purpose and measurable outcome.

## Reasoning

Controls without stated purpose cannot be evaluated for effectiveness.
Controls without measurable outcomes cannot be validated. Every control
must articulate what it is intended to achieve and how achievement will
be measured. Implicit purpose leads to unclear value and unverifiable
claims.

If you cannot state what a control does, you cannot know if it works.

## Justification

Organizations accumulate controls without clear purpose or measurable
outcomes. These controls consume resources, create friction, and
provide uncertain value. When asked "what does this control do?" and
"how do we know it works?", unclear answers indicate unclear thinking.

## Operational Uses

- Purpose and outcome documentation for all controls.
- Control effectiveness metrics aligned to stated purpose.
- Control review evaluating against declared outcomes.
- Control retirement when purpose is obsolete.
- Architecture review requiring purpose articulation.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Documentation overhead for obvious controls.
- Purpose statements that are tautological or vague.
- Gaming outcomes to make controls appear effective.
- Analysis paralysis from excessive documentation requirements.
