# ENG-05.03 — Evidence Over Opinion

## Statement

Evidence outranks opinion.

## Reasoning

Security decisions must be grounded in observable evidence, not
intuition, authority, or tradition. Opinions are not verifiable,
do not scale, and cannot be systematically improved. Evidence-based
security enables learning, accountability, and continuous improvement.

When evidence and opinion conflict, evidence wins.

## Justification

Many security decisions are made based on "security intuition" that
is never validated against outcomes. Expensive controls are deployed
without evidence of need. Effective controls are abandoned based on
unfounded concerns. Evidence disciplines decision-making and enables
retrospective evaluation.

## Operational Uses

- Evidence requirements for security decisions.
- Post-decision validation against predicted outcomes.
- Data-driven prioritization of security investments.
- Retrospectives evaluating decisions against evidence.
- Challenge mechanisms for evidence-free assertions.

## Misuse / Abuse Risks

- Analysis paralysis waiting for perfect evidence.
- Rejecting valid intuition that lacks formal evidence.
- Manipulating evidence to support predetermined conclusions.
- Ignoring emerging threats that lack historical evidence.
